WorkChain Records

ðŸ’¡ Project Description

WorkChain Records is a simple, beginner-friendly smart contract designed to demonstrate the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology by recording submitted job assignments on-chain. It serves as a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger for tracking work completion and maintaining a permanent record of contributions.

ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

This contract acts as a central registry for work assignments. Any address can submit a record containing a description of a completed job. The contract assigns a unique, sequential ID to each submission and stores the sender's address and the exact time of submission.

By storing records on the blockchain, we ensure that once a work assignment is logged, it cannot be altered or removed, providing a verifiable history of labor.

The WorkChainRecords contract exposes the following public functions and variables:
